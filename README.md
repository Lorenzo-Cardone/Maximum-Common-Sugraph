in the following directions:

- Version v1 is a sequential re-implementation of the original
code in C language. This code constitutes the starting version
for all subsequent implementations, as it is more coherent with
all following requirements, modifications, and choices.

- Version v2 is a C multi-thread version logically derives from v1.

- Version v3 is an intermediate CPU single-thread implementation
that removes recursion and decreases memory usage.
It is logically the starting point for comparison for the following
two versions.

- Version v4 is a CPU multi-thread implementation based on the
same principles of the following CUDA implementation.

- Version v5 is the GPU many-thread implementation based on v3
and v4.
